    <h2>About</h2>
          
    <p>Learning, understanding, and knowledge are important to me, but it wasn't always that way. In my high school years I didn't care much for school. It took a few years of military service to change my mind and set me on a different path.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
         I started in the field of information technology in my mid-twenties after a course in web design changed my decision to persue a career in business. After graduating with my B.A.S. in Business Administration I found that landing that first "real job" was hard. Somewhere along the way, I found my way into entry level IT support work after getting the CompTIA A+ certification.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        From there I have since acquired a number of other certifications in networking, security, Linux, project management, and IT service management. I have my B.S. in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance amd am recently CISSP certified.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        It is my hope that I can use this website not only to showcase projects that I am working on, but to share my own thoughts and ideas to help others the way others have helped me.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Thanks for visiting this website, which is also a project, and subject to change frequently... Cheers!
