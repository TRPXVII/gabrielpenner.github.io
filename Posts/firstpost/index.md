# The First of Many!

Over the last couple months I've been working on this website and researching platforms on which to host it. I ultimately chose Github pages because it was free and flexible to experiement with. The free part is important because I still don't know what I'm doing. 

My purpose here is to express my own thoughts and ideas on different topics, write about books I've read to encourage others to read (or avoid) them, and link my various platforms in one place as a sort of professional portfolio.

I've been editing the site in Vim on the Ubuntu Subsystem in Windows Terminal. Everything is a learning process here from Vim to Jekyll and HTML. As time goes on I'm sure I will make changes to this site, but for now here I am.

This is my first and only post for now. Until next time.
