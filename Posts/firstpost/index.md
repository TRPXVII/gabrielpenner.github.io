# The first of many!

Over the last couple months now I've been either working on this website or researching which platform to use to host it. Ultimately, I chose Github pages because it was free and flexible to experiement with. The free part is important because I still don't know what I'm doing. The only reason I was able to create this website is because:

1) I used a theme that I then modified, so I had a starting place,

2) I took a web design course in my first go-round in undergrad and managed to remember enough HTML and CSS to modify the site.

I've been editing the site in Vim on the Ubuntu Subsystem in Windows Terminal. I'm forcing myself to learn Vim and the various keybindings which have, in some cases, made things faster and easier. Really everything here has been a learning experience, and as time goes on I'm sure I will make changes to this site.

This is my first and only post for now, and we'll see where this goes.
