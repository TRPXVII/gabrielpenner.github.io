I started working in information technology in my mid-twenties after a course in web design changed my decision to pursue a career in business. I found landing the first business job to be difficult after graduating with my B.A.S. in Business Administration. Instead, I studied for and passed the CompTIA A+ exam while working some odd jobs, and eventually landed a job in desktop support. 

From there I have since acquired a number of other certifications in networking, security, Linux, project management, and IT service management. I have my B.S. in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance, and I am recently CISSP certified.

It is my hope that I can use this website not only to showcase projects that I am working on, but to share my own thoughts and ideas to help others the way others have helped me.
Thanks for visiting this website, which is also a project, and subject to change frequently... Cheers!
